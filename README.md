# r8152 Tarballs

Realtek's official download page requires solving a captcha, which makes it unusable
from scripts. Thus, I re-upload the tarball(s) here.

**WARNING**: Good IT security practice means that you cannot trust me that I didn't tamper
with these files, and you should ALWAYS verify the integrity of the files here against 
a trusted checksum.
You could do that by downloading the tarfile once [from Realtek](https://www.realtek.com/Download/List?cate_id=585), calculating the 
SHA256-sum of that, and embedding that in your script that downloads from here and compare
the download against it.

Bonus fun fact: The official download page seems to offer .tgz or .bz2 file extensions depending on the
OS you download from, but the checksums should still match.

If somebody from Realtek objects to me uploading the files here, please open an issue :)
